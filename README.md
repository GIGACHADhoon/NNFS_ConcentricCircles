# Circle Classification Deep Learning Project

This is a simple weekend project where I built a Deep Learning Neural Network Model to classify concentric circles of different classes. The project is implemented using Python, with Numpy for numerical computations and Matplotlib for data visualization.

## Project Overview

### Objective

The main goal of this project is to train a neural network to classify data points representing concentric circles into different classes.

### Features

- **Data Generation:** I generated synthetic data representing concentric circles of different classes.
- **Model Implementation:** The neural network model is implemented using Numpy for numerical operations.
- **Visualization:** The results and performance of the model are visualized using Matplotlib.

## Project Structure

- **`data_generation.py`:** Python script for generating synthetic data of concentric circles.
- **`neural_network.py`:** Implementation of the Deep Learning Neural Network Model using Numpy.
- **`visualization.py`:** Script for visualizing the generated data and model results.
- **`main.py`:** Main script to run the entire project.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/circle-classification.git
    cd circle-classification
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Project:**

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Results

The model's performance, along with visualizations of the generated data and predictions, can be found in the `results/` directory.
