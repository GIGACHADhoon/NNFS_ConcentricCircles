# Circle Classification Deep Learning Project

This is a simple weekend project where I built a Deep Learning Neural Network Model to classify concentric circles of different classes. The project is implemented using Python, with Numpy for numerical computations and Matplotlib for data visualization.

## Project Overview

### Objective

The main goal of this project is to train a neural network to classify data points representing concentric circles into different classes.

### Features

- **Data Generation:** I generated synthetic data representing concentric circles of different classes.
- **Model Implementation:** The neural network model is implemented using Numpy for numerical operations.
- **Visualization:** The results and performance of the model are visualized using Matplotlib.

## Project Structure

- **`GenerateCCData.py`:** Python Class used for generating synthetic data of concentric circles.
- **`NNFS.py`:** Implementation of the Deep Learning Neural Network Model using Numpy.
- **`PreProcessingToolKit.py`:** Data PreProcessing Class.
- **`LayeredCircleDeepLearning.ipynb`:** Jupyter Notebook Brings everything Together.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourGIGACHADhoon/NNFS_ConcentricCircles.git
    cd NNFS_ConcentricCircles
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install numpy
    pip install matplotlib
    ```
